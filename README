h2. System Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 and a bunch of gems including in the Gemfile
* A postgresql 8.x database server. Other databases MAY work (e.g. mysql), but they are untested.
* A webserver capable of interfacing with Rails applications. Ideally, apache or nginx with mod_passenger installed.
* Linux or OSX. Linux would be easier.

h2. Application Set-up Steps

* Create the database and run migrations, modifying "config/database.yml" to suit your environment.
* Modify "config/initializers/00_inscriptio_init.rb"
* Run bootstrap rake tasks: 
 rake inscriptio:bootstrap:run_all
* Create cron jobs to automatically run rake tasks for sending out notifications expiring and expired reservations as well as deleting bulletin board posts after post lifetime: 
 rake inscriptio:cron_task:delete_posts
 rake inscriptio:cron_task:send_expiration_notification
 rake inscriptio:cron_task:send_expired_notification
 rake inscriptio:cron_task:run_all
